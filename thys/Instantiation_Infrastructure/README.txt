This folder contains some infrastructure to support the instantiation of binder datatypes and binding-aware rule induction: 
* a type of countable (Aleph_0) variables
* a type of uncountable (Aleph_1) variables
* lemmas for switching between LFPs of n-ary predicates in curried vs. uncurried form 
(for n = 2,3,4,5,...)
